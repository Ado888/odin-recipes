            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double 
                    thickness of foil.</li>

                    alt="foiled spare ribs">
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Unwrap and 
                    drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later 
                    in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.</li>

                    alt="baked spare ribs">
                <li>Mix together brown sugar, chile sauce, ketchup, soy sauce,
                     Worcestershire sauce, rum, garlic, mustard, and pepper in 
                     a bowl. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room 
                     temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 8 hours to 
                     overnight.</li>

                <li>Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position grate 4 inches 
                    above heat source; grease the grate with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting 
                    with marinade.</li>

                <p>You may also bake the ribs for 30 minutes for the final step, 
                    basting with sauce while they bake.</p>
